# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

To analyze the outcomes of theater category campaigns based on date of launch, and play subcategory campaigns based on dollar goals

### Purpose

To use analysis findings to help Louise determine an accurate fundraiser goal range and ideal launch period to focus on, and increase her probability of successful campaign outcomes   

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

There is a greater chance of successful theater campaigns if they’re launched in May or June with the number of successful campaigns of this category being roughly twice as many as failed plus canceled campaigns while contributing to a quarter of the total theater campaigns launched throughout the year  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Louise should look to focus on raising funds for plays with a goal of <$5000 as it increases her likelihood of success as well as forming three-fourths of all successful plays

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The prescribed ranges for ‘Goal’ can be potentially misleading as between ‘45000 to 49999’ and ‘Greater than 50000’ there are 14 campaigns with a goal of exactly $50,000 that can fall outside of the data range

## Results

* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    - There is a greater chance of successful theater campaigns if they’re launched in May or June
    - Theater campaigns launched in May and June form a quarter of the total theater campaigns launched throughout the year 

* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

![Outcomes Based on Goals](file:///Users/kesh/Desktop/Data%20Analytics%20Bootcamp/Analysis%20Projects/Crowdfunding%20Analysis/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

    -	Louise should look to focus on raising funds for plays with a goal of <$5,000
    -	Plays with a goal of <$5,000 form three-fourths of all successful plays


* What are some limitations of this dataset?

  -	The dataset excludes all campaigns of the ‘live’ outcome category from its analysis
  -	Including reasons/causes for success and failure of campaigns can help provide a more complete picture and identify patterns for what contributed to the success or failure of a campaign

* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  -	Analyze the average donation by category against their goals to help understand and prioritize targeted campaigns
  -	Analyze the percentage funded against number of backers to identify campaigns whose pledged amounts are significantly greater than their goals and have a large number of backers
